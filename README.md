# Game
A small game where you fight 7 bosses in a row.

In this game, you will have several weapons to fight 7 bosses nonstop. You can replenish your health with potions, or risk going into the next fight with low health. Damage will be upgraded for each weapon, but the bosses will get harder as well. Let's see how far you can get.

## Running

Clone this repository and compile the source files in `src` (requires Java 8). Once that's done just run `java Main` to start the game.
